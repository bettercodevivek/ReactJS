      Hey! <span>&#128075;</span> I'm a computer science undergrad on a mission to turn caffeine into code.
       From hacking away at late-night coding sessions to unraveling the mysteries of algorithms, 
       I thrive on the thrill of problem-solving. Fluent in the languages of Python, Java, and C++, 
       I've been on a journey of turning lines of code into functional and innovative solutions. 
       My portfolio is a blend of passion projects, where I've dived into the worlds of web development, 
       software design, and beyond. Whether it's building a sleek website or crafting algorithms that make you go "aha!",
        I love the creative dance between logic and creativity. Ready to bring my tech mojo to the table,
        I'm excited about the next adventure in the ever-evolving world of code. Let's create some digital magic together!
